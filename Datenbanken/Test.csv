Then, the property of the whole max ordinal is opened out by the correlative proved theorem. The research indicates that the length of the whole max ordinal is smaller than the length of the sequence, and the difference of the sequence length and the whole max ordinal length increases along with the increase of the sequence length.

Few works in the literature have considered implementations of pairings on the former applications despite their growing importance in a post-PC world. In this paper, we investigate the efficient computation of the Optimal-Ate pairing over special class of pairing friendly Barreto-Naehrig curves in software at different security levels. We target both applications and perform our implementations on ARM-powered processors (with and without NEON instructions) and PC processors. We exploit state-of-the-art techniques and propose new optimizations to speed up the computation in the different levels including tower field and curve arithmetic. In particular, we extend the concept of lazy reduction to inversion in extension fields, analyze an efficient alternative for the sparse multiplication used inside the Miller’s algorithm and reduce further the cost of point/line evaluation formulas in affine and projective homogeneous coordinates. In addition, we study the efficiency of using M-type and D-type sextic twists in the pairing computation and carry out a detailed comparison between affine, Jacobian, and homogeneous coordinate systems. Our implementations on various mass-market emerging embedded devices significantly improve the state-of-the-art of pairing computation on ARM-powered devices and x86-64 PC platforms.

For an ordered sequence of combinations, the unranking function generates the combination associated to an integer number in the ordered sequence. In this paper, we present a new method for unranking combinations by using a gradient-based optimization approach. Exhaustive experiments within computable allowable limits confirmed the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed approach. Particularly, our algorithmic realization aided by a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) was able to generate arbitrary combinations within 0.571 seconds and 8 iterations in the worst case scenario, for n up to 1000 and m up to 100. Also, the performance and efficiency to generate combinations are independent of n, being meritorious when n is very large compared to m, or when n is time-varying. Furthermore, the number of required iterations to generate the combinations by the gradient-based optimization decreases with m in average, implying the attractive scalability in terms of m. Our proposed approach offers the building blocks to enable the succinct modeling and the efficient optimization of combinatorial structures.","","","10.1109/ICTAI.2018.00094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8576092","combinations;unranking;optimization;representation;gradient based optimization;m our of n;combinatorial;binomial;k out of n;combinatorics","Cost function;Convergence;Graphics processing units;Scalability;Heuristic algorithms","combinatorial mathematics;computability;gradient methods;graphics processing units;optimisation;sequences","unranking combinations;ordered sequence;unranking function;gradient-based optimization approach;combinatorial problems;integer number;graphics processing unit;combinatorial structures","","","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, optimization-by-sampling paradigm based on the stochastic approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) sampling has shown superior performance in solving the heterogeneous RAP for multistate systems (MSSs). However, one drawback of this method is that the global move of a Markov chain relying only on a uniform distribution is typically hard to hit the low-energy regions due to the uninformative proposal, leading to insufficient global exploration in sampling. To address the problem of where to sample for efficient optimization of heterogeneous RAP,we introduce a rejection-free Monte Carlo method to sample from the target distribution over the combinatorial space. Specifically, a model-based proposal learning algorithm is derived to guide the global exploration towards promising regions of the descrete state space. Experimental evaluations on a set of benchmark instances show the superiority of the proposed approach compared with the several state-of-the-arts in terms of the solution quality and computational efficiency.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2867744","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Capital Normal University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453039","Redundancy allocation problem;multi-state system;optimization-by-sampling;Markov chain Monte Carlo;model-based proposal learning","Optimization;Proposals;Monte Carlo methods;Resource management;Redundancy;Markov processes","approximation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;optimisation","multistate systems;Markov chain;model-based proposal learning algorithm;rugged combinatoric landscapes;optimization-by-sampling paradigm;stochastic approximation Monte Carlo sampling;redundancy allocation problem;RAP;SAMC;MSS","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The diameter of a polytope has been studied from many different perspectives, including a computational complexity point of view. In particular, [Frieze and Teng, 1994] showed that computing the diameter of a polytope is (weakly) NP-hard. In this paper, we show that the problem of computing the diameter is strongly NP-hard even for a polytope with a very simple structure: namely, the fractional matching polytope. We also show that computing a pair of vertices at maximum shortest path distance on the 1-skeleton of this polytope is an APX-hard problem. We prove these results by giving an exact characterization of the diameter of the fractional matching polytope, that is of independent interest.","","","10.1109/FOCS.2018.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8555168","Polyhedral combinatorics;diameter of polytopes;matching theory","Optimization;Upper bound;NP-hard problem;Computational complexity;Linear programming;Skeleton;Computer science","computational complexity;graph theory;optimisation;pattern matching","fractional matching polytope;hardness implications;APX-hard problem;maximum shortest path distance;NP-hard","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among them is the function generating method and the Markov chain imbedding approach. A different approach stems from using basic combinatorics. It has been presented in various articles and it is intended here to give a short summary. Various criteria are suggested for determining whether to accept or reject the tested equipment. These include the older and simpler ones like CSTF (continuous successes total failures) according to which acceptance is achieved if a certain length of run of successes comes before a specified total number of failures, and vice versa for rejection. A more advanced test criterion is for instance TSCSTFCF (total successes continuous successes total failures continuous failures) where the equipment is accepted if either there appears a certain length of run of successes or a specified total number of successes is encountered before a pre-specified length of a run of failures and a certain total number of failures. It is rejected if the opposite case is observed. Using a combinatorial approach, features like the expected number of tests and the probability of accepting the tested unit are evaluated. Further on, an optimization procedure for determining the various parameters that are involved in the process will be presented. The reasonable objective of minimizing the number of required tests is considered. This is carried out subject to confidence level constraints. The theory has been expanded to include multi-valued tests and to possibly assuming some dependence between the tests. A recent generalization to the two-dimensional case will also be included.","","","10.1109/SMRLO.2016.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7433098","start-up demonstration tests;acceptance testing;expected number of tests;probability of acceptance","Optimization;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Testing;Analytical models;Reliability engineering","combinatorial mathematics;Markov processes;optimisation","combinatorial approach;start-up demonstration tests;function generating method;Markov chain imbedding approach;basic combinatorics;advanced test criterion;instance TSCSTFCF;total successes continuous successes;probability;optimization procedure;confidence level constraints;multivalued tests;total failures continuous failures","","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Remote state preparation (RSP) is a similar distributed task in which the sender knows the entire classical description of the state to be sent. (This may also be viewed as the task of nonoblivious compression of a single sample from an ensemble of quantum states.) We study the communication complexity of approximate RSP (ARSP) in which the goal is to prepare an approximation of the desired quantum state. Jain (Quant. Inf. & Comp., 2006) showed that the worst-case communication complexity of ARSP can be bounded from above in terms of the maximum possible information in an encoding. He also showed that this quantity is a lower bound for communication complexity of (exact) remote state preparation. In this paper, we tightly characterize the worst-case and average-case communication complexity of remote state preparation in terms of nonasymptotic information-theoretic quantities. We also show that the average-case communication complexity of RSP can be much smaller than the worst-case one. In the process, we show that $n$ bits cannot be communicated with less than $n$ transmitted bits in local operations and classical communication protocols. This strengthens a result due to Nayak and Salzman (J.

Namely, the users are purposely paired to decode the common messages to subtract interferences. Both the private messages and common messages are further beamformed before the transmission to maximize the worst user's rate performance of the overall system. The common messages and private messages are decoded in sequence. Obviously, users pairing optimization alone already is a nontrivial combinatorics, while beamforming private and common messages also pose a difficult nonconvex optimization problem. Their jointly optimal design is thus a hard mixed combinatoric optimization problem. Nevertheless, we show that this joint design can be successfully addressed by means of d.c (difference of convex functions) optimization.

The proposed methodology separates aircraft by modifying their trajectories and departure times. This route/departure-time assignment problem is modeled as a mixed-integer optimization problem.

At the same time, this communication technology poses a great threat to the system in those countries that wish to control the information flow. As a result, the Internet is subject to be under censorship, which is, however, a great privacy issue. Deploying decoy routers is one emerging approach to tackle this issue, since it helps each packet whose destination is a prohibited server to hide its ultimate destination from the censorship authority also known as warden. The recent report by Schuchard et al. shows an existence of an efficient approach to detect and isolate active decoy routers from the public. As a countermeasure, they propose to deploy decoy routers surrounding a target country such that isolating the decoy routers will result in isolating the the country from the rest of the Internet. Based on our observation that this problem in fact is with two opposite optimization goals, minimizing the number of decoy routers and maximizing the confinement rate, we introduce two polynomial time algorithms which handle this deployment problem under the presence of uncooperative ASes. We also conduct simulations to compare and analyze the performance of our algorithms.","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2013.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735687","Internet censorship;decoy routing;decoy router deployment;Internet privacy;Internet routing;BGP;Telex;Cirripede","Particle separators;Internet;Polynomials;Bipartite graph;Routing;Servers;Privacy","combinatorial mathematics;data privacy;Internet;telecommunication network routing","combinatoric methods;Internet censorship;information flow;privacy issue;decoy router deployment;optimization goal;polynomial time algorithms;deployment problem;uncooperative autonomous system","","1","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Initially, a combinatorial problem is solved to identify collision-free paths originally designed for a point object. Then the problem of moving the actual object through the safe paths for the point object is posed as an optimal control problem and is solved using a numerical technique involving finite-dimensional optimization. Some of the constraints to the optimization problem are in the form of inequalities, resulting in nondifferentiable expression when augmented with the performance index. Because of this, the R. Hooke and T.A. Jeeves method (1961), which is computationally quite prohibitive, has been adopted. To overcome this burden, at least partially, a method has been introduced whereby several variables appearing in the optimization are grouped into aggregate quantities, thus reducing the number of actual variables used in the iterations. 2-D and 3-D examples illustrate the applicability of the proposed hybrid design.<>","","","10.1109/CDC.1988.194740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=194740","","Path planning;Optimal control;Constraint optimization;Robot kinematics;Torque;Combinatorial mathematics;Performance analysis;Design optimization;Aggregates;Production facilities","artificial intelligence;optimal control;optimisation;position control;robots","obstacle avoidance;hybrid design;robot path planning;optimal control;combinatorial problem;collision-free paths;finite-dimensional optimization","","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper develops a Markov analysis of BBO, including the option of elitism. Our analysis gives the probability of BBO convergence to each possible population distribution for a given problem. We compare our BBO Markov analysis with a similar genetic algorithm (GA) Markov analysis. Analytical comparisons on three simple problems show that with high mutation rates the performance of GAs and BBO is similar, but with low mutation rates BBO outperforms GAs. Our analysis also shows that elitism is not necessary for all problems, but for some problems it can significantly improve performance.","","","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346058","biogeography-based optimization;evolutionary algorithms;probability;combinatorics;Markov analysis","Intersymbol interference;Biogeography;Genetic mutations;Evolutionary computation;Algorithm design and analysis;Performance analysis;USA Councils;Genetic algorithms;Mathematical model;Cybernetics","biology;genetic algorithms;Markov processes;probability","biogeography-based optimization algorithm;population distribution;evolutionary algorithm;geographical organism distribution;island;Markov analysis;probability;genetic algorithm","","46","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The derived learning algorithm is based on a probabilistic generative model which parameterizes object shapes, object features and the background. No assumptions are made for the object orders in depth or the objects' planar positions. Parameter optimization is thus subject to the large combinatorics of depth orders and positions. Previous approaches constrained this combinatorics but were still only able to learn a very small number of objects. By applying a novel variational EM approach, we show that even without constraints on the object combinatorics, a relatively large number of objects can be learned. In different numerical experiments, our unsupervised approach extracts explicit object representations with object masks and object features closely aligned with the true objects in the scenes. We investigate the robustness of the approach and the use of the learned representations for inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate generality of the approach by applying it to grayscale images, color-vector images, and Gabor-vector images as well as to motion trajectory data for which the extracted components correspond to motion primitives.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247953","","Annealing;Visualization;Approximation methods;Feature extraction;Optimization;Vectors;Videos","computer graphics;image colour analysis;image motion analysis;inference mechanisms;optimisation;probability;unsupervised learning","unsupervised learning;translation invariant occlusive components;object occlusion;visual scene image;probabilistic generative model;object shape parameterization;object features parameterization;background parameterization;parameter optimization;variational EM approach;object combinatorics;explicit object representation extraction;object masks;inference;grayscale images;color-vector images;Gabor-vector images;motion trajectory data;motion primitives","","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These concatenation costs are used to evaluate spectral mismatches between the acoustic units to be concatenated. The combinatorics of costs grows exponentially with the size of the acoustic inventories and can result in hundreds of millions or even billions of concatenation costs to be processed. Therefore, in this paper, we represent a novel unit selection optimization algorithm, which minimizes the size of concatenation costs through the vector quantization-based compression technique and tuple structures. Furthermore, the proposed optimization algorithm is designed to be used as an objective measure to optimize the performance of the unit selection cost function regarding the quality of the speech output, and to evaluate the effect of the vector quantization-based compression technique on its performance. The results obtained show that even when data compression is above 50%, the effect on the quality of the synthesized speech is negligible.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932750","European Regional Development Fund; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8786202","Unit selection optimization;vector quantization;data compression;RGD algorithm;RBF-based neural networks;unit selection cost function;concatenation costs","Acoustics;Speech synthesis;Cost function;Signal processing algorithms;Data compression;Genetic algorithms","acoustic signal processing;concatenated codes;optimisation;radial basis function networks;speech coding;speech synthesis;vector quantisation","acoustic inventory;concatenation costs;unit selection cost function;corpus-based TTS systems;corpus-based speech synthesis systems;optimal representation;vector quantization;RBF;unit selection optimisation algorithm;data compression technique;spectral mismatches;text to speech system","","","","48","CCBY","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach has two basic advantages over software-correction methods. First, there is no software interface imposed on graphical programs: all imagery displayed on the projector benefits from the calibration immediately, without render-time overhead or code changes. Secondly, the approach benefits from the fact that projector hardware settings typically are capable of expanding or shifting color gamuts (e.g. trading off maximum brightness versus darkness of black levels), something that software methods, which only shrink gamuts, cannot do. In practice this means that hardware settings can possibly match colors between projectors while maintaining a larger overall color gamut (e.g. better contrast) than software-only correction can. The prototype system is fully automatic. The space of hardware settings is explored by using a computer-controlled universal remote to navigate each projector's menu system. An off-the-shelf camera observes each projector's response curves. A cost function is computed for the curves based on their similarity to each other, as well as intrinsic characteristics, including color balance, black level, gamma, and dynamic range. An approximate optimum is found using a heuristic combinatoric search. Results show significant qualitative improvements in the absolute colors, as well as the color consistency, of the display.","","","10.1109/CVPRW.2009.5204322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204322","","Calibration;Displays;Hardware;Brightness;Color;Photometry;Rendering (computer graphics);Software prototyping;Prototypes;Navigation","calibration;colour displays;optimisation;search problems;user interfaces","multiprojector display;color calibration;automatic hardware setting optimization;automatic camera-based photometric projector calibration;software-correction method;graphical program;computer-controlled universal remote;menu system;cost function;intrinsic characteristics;color balance;black level;dynamic range;heuristic combinatoric search","","2","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Notably, we analyze the defense against timing attacks, simple power analysis, differential power analysis, and fault attacks. Luckily, the SIDH protocol closely resembles its predecessor, the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange. As such, much of the extensive literature in side-channel analysis can also apply to SIDH. In particular, we focus on a hardware implementation that features a true random number generator, ALU, and controller. SIDH is composed of two rounds containing a double-point multiplication to generate a secret kernel point and an isogeny over that kernel to arrive at a new elliptic curve isomorphism. To protect against simple power analysis and timing attacks, we recommend a constant-time implementation with Fermat's little theorem inversion. Differential power analysis targets the power output of the SIDH core over many runs. As such, we recommend scaling the base points by secret scalars so that each iteration has a unique power signature. Further, based on recent oracle attacks on SIDH, we cannot recommend the use of static keys from both parties. The goal of this paper is to analyze the tradeoffs in elliptic curve theory to produce a cryptographically and physically secure implementation of SIDH.","","","10.1109/HST.2017.7951824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7951824","Post-quantum cryptography;isogeny-based cryptography;side-channel analysis;hardware architectures","Electronic mail;Elliptic curves;Cryptography;Quantum computing;Protocols;Timing;Hardware","cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;random number generation","quantum-resistant supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman protocol;quantum-resistant SIDH protocol;timing attacks;simple power analysis;differential power analysis;fault attacks;elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange;ECDH key exchange;side-channel analysis;true random number generator;ALU;double-point multiplication;secret kernel point;elliptic curve isomorphism;Fermat little theorem inversion;secret scalars;oracle attacks;elliptic curve theory","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a blind source separation (BSS) problem from a SP viewpoint. Research on this topic started in the 1990s in geoscience and remote sensing [3]-[7], enabled by technological advances in hyperspectral sensing at the time. In recent years, blind HU has attracted much interest from other fields such as SP, machine learning, and optimization, and the subsequent cross-disciplinary research activities have made blind HU a vibrant topic. The resulting impact is not just on remote sensing - blind HU has provided a unique problem scenario that inspired researchers from different fields to devise novel blind SP methods. In fact, one may say that blind HU has established a new branch of BSS approaches not seen in classical BSS studies. In particular, the convex geometry concepts - discovered by early remote sensing researchers through empirical observations [3]-[7] and refined by later research - are elegant and very different from statistical independence-based BSS approaches established in the SP field. Moreover, the latest research on blind HU is rapidly adopting advanced techniques, such as those in sparse SP and optimization. The present development of blind HU seems to be converging to a point where the lines between remote sensing-originated ideas and advanced SP and optimization concepts are no longer clear, and insights from both sides would be used to establish better methods.","","","10.1109/MSP.2013.2279731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6678258","","Tutorials;Hyperspectral imaging;Vectors;Noise Measurement","blind source separation;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;optimisation;regression analysis;remote sensing","signal processing perspective;blind hyperspectral unmixing;unsupervised HU;hyperspectral remote sensing;spectral resolution;hyperspectral images;blind source separation;BSS;machine learning;convex geometry;matrix factorization","","218","","79","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We consider optimization problems in tanglegram drawings. We show a linear time algorithm to decide if a tanglegram admits a planar embedding by a reduction to the planar graph drawing problem. This problem was also studied by Fernau et al. A similar reduction to a graph crossing problem also helps to solve an open problem they posed, showing a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for minimizing the number of crossings over all d-ary trees. For the case where one tree is fixed, we show an O(n( log n) algorithm to determine the drawing of the second tree that minimizes the number of crossings. This improves the bound from earlier methods. We introduce a new optimization criterion using Spearman's footrule distance and give an O(n2) algorithm.

Computational complexity is a chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g., in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization. While past efforts at solving multiple pursuer problems have suffered from the curse of dimensionality, the geometric algorithms put forth here are shown to be scalable. Categorization and removal of redundant pursuers is the primary means by which scalability is achieved. The solution of this problem serves as a stepping stone to more complex problems such as the M-pursuer N-evader differential game.","","","10.1109/ICUAS.2018.8453470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453470","","Games;Optimization;Vehicle dynamics;Military aircraft;Electronic mail;Aircraft;Aircraft propulsion","combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;differential games;optimisation","single-evader differential game;capture time;computational complexity;chief concern;autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles;geometric approach;discrete combinatoric optimization;multiple pursuer problems;geometric algorithms;redundant pursuers;complex problems;multiple pursuers;evader pursuit-evasion","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our algorithms return a pricing scheme and a subset of customers that are designated the winners, which satisfy the envy-freeness constraint, whereas in our analyses, we compare the profit of our solution against the optimal value of the corresponding social-welfare-maximization (SWM) problem of finding a winner-set with maximum total value. Our algorithms take any LP-based alpha-approximation algorithm for the corresponding SWM problem as input and return a solution that achieves profit at least OPT/O (alpha ldr log umax), where OPT is the optimal value of the SWM problem, and umax is the maximum supply of an item. This immediately yields approximation guarantees of O(radicmlog umax) for the general single-minded envy-free problem; and O(log umax) for the tollbooth and highway problems (Guruswami et al., 2005), and the graph-vertex pricing problem (Balcan and Blum, 2006) (alpha = O(1) for all the corresponding SWM problems). Since OPT is an upper bound on the maximum profit achievable by any solution (i.e., irrespective of whether the solution satisfies the envy-freeness constraint), our results directly carry over to the non-envy-free versions of these problems too. Our result also thus (constructively) establishes an upper bound of O(alpha ldr log umax) on the ratio of (i) the optimum value of the profit-maximization problem and OPT; and (ii) the optimum profit achievable with and without the constraint of envy-freeness.","","","10.1109/FOCS.2008.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4690938","Algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Pricing problems;Envy-free profit-maximization;Algorithmic game theory;Linear programming","Approximation algorithms;Pricing;Optimized production technology;Algorithm design and analysis;Upper bound;Computer science;Polynomials;Road transportation;Displays;Combinatorial mathematics","computational complexity;graph theory;optimisation;pricing;profitability","single-minded envy-free profit-maximization;polynomial-time approximation algorithm;pricing scheme;envy-freeness constraint;social-welfare-maximization;LP-based approximation algorithm;optimal value;maximum supply;tollbooth problem;highway problem;graph-vertex pricing problem","","21","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the past decades, researchers have been relying on unproven heuristics to tackle OPF. The hardness of OPF stems from two issues: (1) non-convexity and (2) combinatoric constraints (e.g., discrete power extraction constraints). The recent advances in providing sufficient conditions on the exactness of convex relaxation of OPF can address the issue of non-convexity. To complete the understanding of OPF, this paper presents a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve the convex-relaxed OPF with discrete demands as combinatoric constraints, which has a provably small parameterized approximation ratio (also known as PTAS algorithm). Together with the sufficient conditions on the exactness of the convex relaxation, we provide an efficient approximation algorithm to solve OPF with discrete demands, when the underlying network is radial with a fixed size and one feeder. The running time of PTAS is  $O(n^{4m/\epsilon}T)$ , where $T$ is the time required to solve a convex relaxation of the problem, and  $m, \epsilon$  are fixed constants.

A customer that moves around a massive shopping area, for example 500,000-square-foot needs route guidance to search for the desired items and its location. The retailer on other hand wants to send real-time messages based on the customer's current location in the market. This paper addresses aforementioned problem and presents an intelligent solution for route problem for customer. Raw floor map of supermarket under consideration has been manually transformed into graph for combinatorial optimization. To meet the desired objective, Hungarian's and A* Search algorithms have been used in a cascaded manner to facilitate customer in two ways: (1) Chronological sequencing of items list will be suggested to customer based on the distance between current customer location and the location of item of his interest (2) Customer can also view the suggested single shortest path connecting every location of item of his shopping list based on A* findings. Once the proposed intelligent system navigation service is deployed on customer's smartphone, he or she can send or share item list with system to receive traces of desired location within premises. Results show that Hungarian Algorithm will assign optimal ordering for items to be purchased.

Differential Privacy (DP) has gained acceptance as a framework to quantify vulnerability of algorithms to privacy breaches. We consider the problem of how to sanitize an entire database via a DP mechanism, on which unlimited further querying is performed. While protecting privacy, it is important that the sanitized database still provide accurate responses to queries. The central contribution of this work is to characterize the amount of information preserved in an optimal DP database sanitizing mechanism (DSM). We precisely characterize the utility-privacy trade-off of mechanisms that sanitize databases in the asymptotic regime of large databases. We study this in an information-theoretic framework by modeling a generic distribution on the data, and a measure of fidelity between the histograms of the original and sanitized databases. We consider the popular L₁-distortion metric, i.e., the total variation norm that leads to the formulation as a linear program (LP). This optimization problem is prohibitive in complexity with the number of constraints growing exponentially in the parameters of the problem. Our focus on the asymptotic regime enables us characterize precisely, the limit of the sequence of solutions to this optimization problem. Leveraging tools from discrete geometry, analytic combinatorics, and duality theorems of optimization, we fully characterize this limit in terms of a power series whose coefficients are the number of integer points on a multidimensional convex cross-polytope studied by Ehrhart in 1967. Employing Ehrhart theory, we determine a simple closed form computable expression for the asymptotic growth of the optimal privacy-fidelity trade-off to infinite precision. At the heart of the findings is a deep connection between the minimum expected distortion and a fundamental construct in Ehrhart theory - Ehrhart series of an integral convex polytope.","","","10.1109/TIT.2019.2959976","Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Division of Electrical Communications and Cyber Systems; Army Research Office; Division of Computer and Network Systems; National Institute of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933070","Differential Privacy;fidelity;distortion;information theory;linear programming optimization;Ehrhart theory;discrete geometry;dual LP;analytic combinatorics","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Its main power stems from the fact that it detects logical patterns that can be easily interpreted. These patterns are used in the classification of observations collected by condition monitoring, and thus in the diagnosis of faults. An application is presented.

The settings involving a single leader and two competing leaders are unified into a general combinatoric optimization problem, for which two heuristic approaches are developed. The first approach is based on a convex relaxation scheme, possibly in combination with the .e1-norm regularization technique, and the second is based on a greedy selection strategy. The main technical novelties of this work are in the establishment of supermodularity of the objective function and convexity of its continuous relaxation. The greedy approach is guaranteed to have a lower bound on the approximation ratio sharper than (1 - 1/e), while the convex approach can benefit from efficient (customized) numerical solvers to have practically comparable solutions possibly with faster computation times. The two approaches can be combined to provide improved results. In numerical examples, the approximation ratio can be made to reach 90% or higher depending on the number of direct followers.","","","10.1109/TAC.2018.2850287","Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8395011","Approximation algorithms;convex functions;greedy algorithms;influence maximization;integer linear programming;network theory (graphs)","Optimization;Linear programming;Steady-state;Greedy algorithms;Convergence;Transient analysis;Loss measurement","approximation theory;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;convex programming;greedy algorithms;network theory (graphs)","objective function;convexity;greedy approach;approximation ratio;convex approach;direct followers;leader influence;directed network;fixed competing leader;general combinatoric optimization problem;heuristic approaches;convex relaxation scheme;.e1-norm regularization technique;greedy selection strategy","","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To handle such a tremendous traffic volume while maintaining at least the same level of safety, a more efficient strategic trajectory planning is necessary. Static 4D trajectory planning with constant 4D segments, where aircraft have to stay all along their flights, ensures a strong predictability of traffic and may reduce congestion in airspace. The main limitation of this approach is linked to the 4D constraint associated to aircraft. As a matter of fact, each aircraft has to comply to this 4D segment to maintain separation from other aircraft, but this induces a real time control of the engine in order to stay all the time in this 4D segment. This could result in extra fuel consumption and shorter engine life. In this work, we present an adaptive 4D strategic trajectory planning methodology which aims to minimize interaction between aircraft at the European-continent scale. The main purpose of this work is to associate to each aircraft a 4D bubble which is adapted to the current traffic situation. When aircraft are located in low density areas, the size of such bubbles can extend (with a maximum range of 20 minutes) and when aircraft enter high congestion areas, such bubbles can shrink until a minimum size of 2 minutes. The size of bubbles is then optimized according to the local density of aircraft. This adaptive process, avoid to constrain aircraft in 4D all along their trajectories. The proposed methodology separates aircraft by modifying their trajectories and departure times. This route/departure-time assignment problem is modeled as a mixed-integer optimization problem. Due to the very high combinatorics involved in the continent-scale context (involving more than 30,000 flights), we develop and implement a hybrid-metaheuristic optimization algorithm. This first optimization is done with a minimum bubble size of 2 minutes. A second optimization loop uses the solution produced by the first algorithm so as to optimally extend the size of the 4D bubbles along trajectories in order to minimize the time constraint of aircraft.","","","10.1109/DASC.2018.8569632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569632","air traffic management;4D aircraft trajectory;strategic planning;adaptive trajectory planning","Trajectory;Aircraft;Planning;Aircraft propulsion;Optimization;Engines;Europe","adaptive control;air safety;air traffic control;aircraft control;aircraft navigation;integer programming;path planning;trajectory control","large scale adaptive 4D trajectory planning;global air-traffic demand;4D bubble;route/departure-time assignment problem;mixed-integer optimization problem;hybrid-metaheuristic optimization algorithm;second optimization loop;adaptive 4D strategic trajectory planning methodology;aircraft;static 4D trajectory planning","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This reduces the latency of performing point addition and speeds up the overall point multiplication. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed data flow of point addition has the lowest latency in comparison to the counterparts available in the literature.

This result is much stronger than the previous known ones; and 3) we study the entanglement cost of distinguishing quantum states. It is proved that √{2/3}|00〉+√{1/3}|11〉 is sufficient and necessary for distinguishing three Bell states by the PPT POVMs. An upper bound of entanglement cost of distinguishing a d ⊗ d pure state and its orthogonal complement is obtained for separable operations. Based on this bound, we are able to construct two orthogonal quantum states, which cannot be distinguished unambiguously by separable POVMs, but finite copies would make them perfectly distinguishable by local operations and classical communication. We further observe that a two-qubit maximally entangled state is always enough for distinguishing a d ⊗ d pure state and its orthogonal complement by the PPT POVMs, no matter the value of d. In sharp contrast, an entangled state with Schmidt number at least d is always needed for distinguishing such two states by separable POVMs. As an application, we show that the entanglement cost of distinguishing a d ⊗ d maximally entangled state and its orthogonal complement must be a maximally entangled state for d=2, which implies that teleportation is optimal, and in general, it could be chosen as O(logd/d).","","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2307575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747300","Quantum nonlocality;local distinguishability;PPT POVMs;entanglement cost","Quantum entanglement;Quantum computing;Educational institutions;Information theory;Laboratories;Vectors","information theory;quantum entanglement","positive operator valued measures;positive partial transpose;bipartite quantum states;open problem;finite copies;two qubit maximally entangled state;Schmidt number","","18","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new algorithm is supported by the vector quantization (VQ) and the fast match (FM) techniques to speed up the classification process. The Walsh transform (WT) and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are adopted as feature extraction tools. The application of the combined fast match-dynamic time warping (FM-DTW) algorithms provides superior results in speed and accuracy compared to the traditional artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic classifiers.

We study this problem in the cell probe model introduced by Yao [1981]. Recently, Beame and Fich [2002] obtained optimal bounds on the number of probes needed by any deterministic query scheme if the associated storage scheme uses only n/sup O(1)/ cells of word size (log m)/sup O(1)/ bits. We give a new lower bound proof for this problem that matches the bounds of Beame and Fich. Our lower bound proof has the following advantages: it works for randomised query schemes too, while Beame and Fich's proof works for deterministic query schemes only. In addition, it is simpler than Beame and Fich's proof. We prove our lower bound using the round elimination approach of Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson [1998]. Using tools from information theory, we prove a strong round elimination lemma for communication complexity that enables us to obtain a tight lower bound for the predecessor problem. We also use our round elimination lemma to obtain a rounds versus communication tradeoff for the 'greater-than' problem, improving on the tradeoff in [1998].

Both of these multipliers are of sequential type - after receiving the coordinates of the two input field elements, they go through m iterations (or clock cycles) to finally yield all the coordinates of the product in parallel. These multipliers are highly area efficient and require fewer number of logic gates even when compared with the most area efficient multiplier available in the open literature. This makes the proposed multipliers suitable for applications where the value of m is large but space is of concern, e.g., resource constrained cryptographic systems. Additionally, the AND gate count for one of the multipliers is /spl lfloor/m/2/spl rfloor/+1 only. This implies that if the multiplication over GF(2/sup m/) is performed using a suitable subfield GF(2/sup n/), where n>1 and n|m, then the corresponding multiplier architecture will yield a highly efficient digit or word serial multiplier.","","","10.1109/ARITH.2003.1207678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207678","","Galois fields;Computer architecture;Delay;Arithmetic;Cryptography;Hardware;Logic gates;Clocks;Polynomials;Error correction","multiplying circuits;logic gates;sequential circuits;digital arithmetic;circuit complexity;parallel architectures","sequential normal basis multiplier architecture;finite field arithmetic;logic gate;cryptographic system;AND gate;digit serial multiplier;word serial multiplier;Massey-Omura multiplier;optimal normal basis","","7","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past, it was shown that, for a class of finite fields defined by irreducible all-one polynomials, the parallel Massey-Omura multiplier had redundancy and a modified architecture of lower circuit complexity was proposed. In this article, it is shown that, not only does this type of multiplier contain redundancy in that special class of finite fields, but it also has redundancy in fields GF(2/sup m/) defined by any irreducible polynomial. By removing the redundancy, we propose a new architecture for the normal basis parallel multiplier, which is applicable to any arbitrary finite field and has significantly lower circuit complexity compared to the original Massey-Omura normal basis parallel multiplier. The proposed multiplier structure is also modular and, hence, suitable for VLSI realization.

It is also closely related to the lossy distributed source coding task. Our main result is an achievable communication region for this task in the one-shot setting, through which we obtain a nearly optimal characterization using auxiliary random variables of bounded size. We employ our achievability result to provide a nearly optimal one-shot communication region for the task of lossy distributed source coding, in terms of auxiliary random variables of bounded size.

Firstly, we show that a separation in computational power persists even when the constant-depth quantum circuit is restricted to geometrically local gates in one dimension. The corresponding quantum algorithm is the simplest we know of which achieves a quantum advantage of this type. Our second, main result, is that a separation persists even if the shallow quantum circuit is corrupted by noise. We construct a relation problem which can be solved with near certainty using a noisy constant-depth quantum circuit composed of geometrically local gates in three dimensions, provided the noise rate is below a certain constant threshold value. On the other hand, the problem cannot be solved with high probability by a noise-free classical circuit of constant depth.

Such information may, however, be unavailable or difficult to obtain. Moreover, one is often primarily interested in enforcing a desirable target flow as the equilibrium by suitably influencing player behavior in the routing game. We ask whether one can achieve target flows as equilibria without knowing the underlying latency functions. Our main result gives a crisp positive answer to this question. We show that, under fairly general settings, one can efficiently compute edge tolls that induce a given target multicommodity flow in a nonatomic routing game using a polynomial number of queries to an oracle that takes candidate tolls as input and returns the resulting equilibrium flow. This result is obtained via a novel application of the ellipsoid method, and applies to arbitrary multicommodity settings and non-linear latency functions. Our algorithm extends easily to many other settings, such as (i) when certain edges cannot be tolled or there is an upper bound on the total toll paid by a user, and (ii) general nonatomic congestion games. We obtain tighter bounds on the query complexity for series-parallel networks, and single-commodity routing games with linear latency functions, and complement these with a query-complexity lower bound applicable even to single-commodity routing games on parallel-link graphs with linear latency functions. We also explore the use of Stackelberg routing to achieve target equilibria and obtain strong positive results for series-parallel graphs. Our results build upon various new techniques that we develop pertaining to the computation of, and connections between, different notions of approximate equilibrium, properties of multicommodity flows and tolls in series-parallel graphs, and sensitivity of equilibrium flow with respect to tolls. Our results demonstrate that one can indeed circumvent the potentially-onerous task of modeling latency functions, and yet obtain meaningful results for the underlying routing game.","","","10.1109/FOCS.2014.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6978987","Network routing;tolls;ellipsoid method;approximate equilibria;multicommodity flows;Stackelberg routing","Routing;Games;Delays;Ellipsoids;Complexity theory;Polynomials;Computational modeling","computational complexity;game theory;graph theory;network theory (graphs);query processing","network routing games;edge tolls;multicommodity flow;nonatomic routing game;polynomial number;oracle;ellipsoid method;arbitrary multicommodity settings;nonatomic congestion games;series-parallel networks;linear latency functions;nonlinear latency functions;query-complexity lower bound;single-commodity routing games;parallel-link graphs;target equilibria;series-parallel graphs;approximate equilibrium","","10","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focus on nonlinear kernel based classification methods expressed as a regularized loss minimization problem. We address the challenges associated with both rare class problems and large scale learning, by 1) optimizing area under curve of the receiver of operator characteristic in the training process, instead of classification accuracy and 2) using a rare class kernel representation to achieve an efficient time and space algorithm.

This special private key can only be used to decrypt the ciphertext which is of all the specified groups' interests, its holders are excluded from decrypting when the documents are not targeted to all these groups (e.g., the ciphertext of only a single group's interest). While recent advances in cryptographic techniques (e.g., attribute-based encryption or wicked IBE) can support a more general access control policy, the private key size may be as long as the number of attributes or identifiers that can be specified in a ciphertext, which is undesirable, especially when each user may receive a number of such keys for different decryption power.

Nonetheless, this confidentiality does not guarantee their reliability in the presence of natural and malicious faults. In this paper, fault diagnosis schemes for the lightweight internationally standardized block cipher CLEFIA are proposed. This symmetric-key cipher is compatible with yet lighter in hardware than the Advanced Encryption Standard and enables the implementation of cryptographic functionality with low complexity and power consumption. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%. Finally, both application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate array implementations of the proposed error detection structures are presented to assess their efficiency and overhead. The proposed fault diagnosis architectures make the implementations of the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission-standardized CLEFIA more reliable.","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2228144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6355994","Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC);CLEFIA symmetric-key block cipher;efficient error detection;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);reliability","Hardware;Encryption;Fault diagnosis;Circuit faults;Field programmable gate arrays","application specific integrated circuits;cryptography;fault diagnosis;field programmable gate arrays;table lookup","efficient fault diagnosis schemes;reliable lightweight cryptographic ISO/IEC standard CLEFIA;ASIC;FPGA;lightweight block ciphers;sensitive constrained applications;standardized block cipher CLEFIA;symmetric key cipher;advanced encryption standard;cryptographic functionality;power consumption;error detection;nonlinear S-boxes;lookup table realizations;fault injection simulations;integrated circuit and field programmable gate array;error detection structures;fault diagnosis architectures;standardization International electrotechnical commission standardized CLEFIA;international organization","","26","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The real radical ideal (RRI) of V is the infinite set of multivariate polynomials that vanish on V . We give theoretical results that yield a finite step numerical algorithm for testing if a given polynomial is a member of this RRI. The paper exploits recent work that connects solution sets of such real polynomial systems with solution sets of semidefinite programming, SDP, problems involving moment matrices. We take advantage of an SDP technique called facial reduction. This technique regularizes our problem by projecting the feasible set onto the so-called minimal face. In addition, we use the Douglas-Rachford iterative approach which has advantages over traditional interior point methods for our application. If V has finitely many real solutions, then our method yields a finite set of polynomials in the form of a geometric involutive basis that are generators of the RRI and form an RRI membership test. In the case where the set V has real solution components of positive dimension, and given an input polynomial of degree d, our method can also decide RRI membership via a truncated geometric involutive basis of degree d. Examples are given to illustrate our approach and its advantages that remove multiplicities and sums of squares that cause ill-conditioning for real solutions of polynomial systems.","","","10.1109/SYNASC.2017.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531271","real radical;moment matrix;facial reduction;Douglas Rachford;semidefinite programming.","Rail to rail inputs;Symmetric matrices;Kernel;Frequency modulation;Generators;Programming","computational geometry;iterative methods;mathematical programming;matrix algebra;minimisation;polynomials;set theory","SDP-based method;radical ideal membership test;multivariate polynomial equations;infinite set;finite step numerical algorithm;RRI membership test;truncated geometric involutive basis;interior point methods;semidefinite programming;real radical ideal;Douglas-Rachford iterative approach;minimal face","","","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One advantage of this GNB multiplier is that we are able to reduce the hardware complexity through sharing the addition/accumulation with other field additions. We utilized the special property of normal basis representation and squarings are implemented very efficiently by only rewiring in hardware. We introduce a new technique for point addition in affine coordinate which requires fewer registers. Based on this technique, we propose an extremely small processor architecture for point multiplication.

This suggests that 1) unlimited EPR pairs are not the most general model of entanglement assistance for two-party communication tasks, and 2) the entangling and communicating abilities of a unitary interaction can vary nearly independently.

Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product tau of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sub linear dependence on tau.","","","10.1109/FOCS.2015.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354428","Hamiltonian simulation;quantum algorithms","Complexity theory;Quantum computing;Computational modeling;Hilbert space;Computer science;Heuristic algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Bessel functions;quantum computing","sparse Hamiltonian simulation;near-optimal scaling;quantum walk;fractional-query simulation;Bessel function","","34","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors prove that the problem can be represented as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and show that the latter yields a solution that consists of transmit power levels that are ""strongly Pareto optimal"". It was demonstrated that the MILP formulation can be used effectively to derive optimal scheduling and power levels for networks with as many as 30 designated communication links. The authors show that the MILP formulation can also be effectively solved to provide upper and lower bounds (corresponding to an approximation factor Delta) for the optimum schedule length of networks with as many as 100 designated links. It is proved that the integrated link scheduling and power control problem (ILSP) is NP-complete. Consequently, a heuristic algorithm of polynomial complexity is developed and investigated for solving the problem in a timely and practical manner. The algorithm is based on the properties of a novel interference graph, i.e., the ""generalized power-based interference graph"", whose ""chromatic"" and ""independence numbers"" provide fundamental bounds for the ILSP. It is demonstrated that the frame length of schedules realized by the heuristic scheme resides in the 25th percentile of those attained by the optimal mechanism for randomly generated topologies with as many as 30 designated communication links.

These questions are relevant because insertion errors frequently occur in synchronization and DNA, a medium which is beginning to be used for long term data storage. For a codeword c of length n, we are interested in two particular measures. The first is the probability of unique decoding when t insertions occur, if each distinct length n + t received word is output with equal probability. The second is the probability of unique decoding when t sequential insertions occur, and each insertion position and element are selected uniformly at random. This paper attempts to better understand the behavior of the measures for arbitrary codewords, placing a particular emphasis on limiting behavior as t or n increases. Our most substantial contribution is the derivation of upper bounds on both measures, which are mathematically related to Levenshtein's reconstruction problem.","","","10.1109/ISIT.2017.8007019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007019","Insertions and Deletions;Codes;Combinatorics;Sequence reconstruction;Varshamov-Tenengolts codes","Decoding;Upper bound;History;Limiting;DNA;Optimization","decoding;probability","unique decoding;insertion errors;DNA;equal probability","","2","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A typical method is to apply limit-checking procedure to locate off-nominal features which do not fall within the expected normal range of values. Human-experts' analysis is usually limited. It focuses on analyzing selected group of features that would interpret a specific situation that might be taking place onboard the satellite. When the size of telemetry features and number of observations are in the order of hundreds or thousands, a full expert-based analysis is almost impossible to achieve. In this paper, expert-based analysis is leveraged by the automation of the telemetry analysis process based on a machine learning technique called the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a pattern recognition and classification approach that combines ideas and concepts from optimization, combinatorics and Boolean functions. One of the main advantages of LAD is its explanatory power, which offers a classification and an interpretation of the root causes of the events under study. Patterns generated via LAD are easily understood by experts as they are constructed from the features within the set of observations. Consequently, LAD is used in numerous practical applications. We are applying LAD in the process of fault diagnosis and prognosis in satellites by combining the domain expert's knowledge and the knowledge extracted by LAD. The procedure begins by performing a fault tree analysis (FTA) and a list of corrective actions, by domain human experts. This analysis is usually limited by the expert's knowledge to represent known faulty states of the system. However, operation data collected over a period of time can introduce meaningful hidden knowledge about faulty states that were not represented in the original FTA. We apply LAD to find this hidden knowledge in data collected through simulation, testing and in-flight operation. The results reflect significant interpretation power and an effective leverage of the obtained knowledge by the integrated telemetry analysis tool when compared to traditional limit-checking method.","","","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396740","","Fault trees;Telemetry;Satellites;Logic gates;Software reliability;Machine learning","aerospace computing;Boolean functions;condition monitoring;data analysis;data mining;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;fault trees;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telemetry","LAD;satellites;domain expert;fault tree analysis;domain human experts;operation data;integrated telemetry analysis tool;human expert knowledge;telemetry data;limit-checking procedure;off-nominal features;telemetry features;expert-based analysis;telemetry analysis process;logical analysis of data;subsystem failures;machine learning technique;pattern classification;pattern recognition;optimization;combinatorics;Boolean functions;in-flight operation","","1","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The procedures consist of the analysis process for offered traffic distribution and the transmitter/receiver (TRX) allocation process. The algorithm for the TRX allocation process significantly reduces the total number of TRXs necessary for carrying offered traffic. The number of radio channels necessary for the whole system is derived using these algorithms. In these design procedures, the formidable combinatorics problem of allocation is reduced to a comparatively simple optimization problem. Simple examples applying these algorithms are used for explanation. These algorithms are also effective for the scheduled channel assignment scheme, which is efficient for traffic distributions whose transitions can be definitely estimated.<>","","","10.1109/25.9886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9886","","Mobile communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Scheduling algorithm;Land mobile radio;Heuristic algorithms;Computer simulation;Communication systems;Prediction algorithms;Radio transmitters;Costs","mobile radio systems;telecommunication channels;telecommunication traffic","transmitter/receiver allocation process;flexible channel assignment;mobile communication systems;large-scale mobile radio systems;offered traffic distribution;TRX allocation process;radio channels;design procedures;combinatorics problem;optimization problem","","60","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Concurrent reuse distance profile defined as the reuse distance profile of a thread sharing the cache with many other threads varies from its standalone reuse distance profile due to interference from other threads. Measurement of reuse distance profile through simulation, especially for multi-threaded applications, consumes lot of time. Analytical model based reuse distance prediction can reduce drastically the time taken for exploring the cache memory design space. The objective of this work is to propose an analytical model to find the concurrent reuse distance profile of a thread belonging to multi-threaded applications in a shared memory environment. Using the standalone reuse distance profile of each thread as input, we derive three other reuse distance profiles: 1) The concurrent reuse distance profile of a thread sharing the cache with other threads 2) The combined reuse distance profile of all threads sharing the cache and 3) The coherent reuse distance profile of each thread, considering the coherency effect when each thread runs with private cache. We use Markov chain besides combinatorics and basic probability theory as a main analytical tool for the model. We validate our analytical model against simulations, using the multi-core simulator Sniper for the benchmarks of the PARSEC and the SPLASH benchmark suites.","","","10.1109/TPDS.2019.2896633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8630685","Reuse distance profile;concurrent reuse distance;cache performance;analytical model;multi-threaded applications;multi-core processors;simulation","Instruction sets;Analytical models;Measurement;Histograms;Complexity theory;Performance analysis","cache storage;Markov processes;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading;optimisation;probability","concurrent reuse distance profile;multithreaded application;standalone reuse distance profile;analytical model based reuse distance prediction;coherent reuse distance profile;thread sharing;performance analysis;locality analysis;compiler optimization;cache memory design space;shared memory environment;probability theory;multicore simulator Sniper;Markov chain","","","","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes and evaluates an optimization algorithm for the powerful de-identification procedure known as k-anonymization. A k-anonymized dataset has the property that each record is indistinguishable from at least k - 1 others. Even simple restrictions of optimized k-anonymity are NP-hard, leading to significant computational challenges. We present a new approach to exploring the space of possible anonymizations that tames the combinatorics of the problem, and develop data-management strategies to reduce reliance on expensive operations such as sorting. Through experiments on real census data, we show the resulting algorithm can find optimal k-anonymizations under two representative cost measures and a wide range of k. We also show that the algorithm can produce good anonymizations in circumstances where the input data or input parameters preclude finding an optimal solution in reasonable time. Finally, we use the algorithm to explore the effects of different coding approaches and problem variations on anonymization quality and performance. To our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating optimal k-anonymization of a non-trivial dataset under a general model of the problem.","","","10.1109/ICDE.2005.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410124","","Data privacy;Proposals;Costs;Iterative algorithms;Sorting;Stochastic processes;Frequency;Data engineering;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning","data privacy;sorting;optimisation;database management systems;tree searching;data integrity","data privacy;data deidentification;optimization algorithm;optimal k-anonymized dataset;data-management strategies;sorting operation","","366","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The regression models are built by transforming the problem into the combinatorial domain where the shape constraints are imposed by bounding the combinatorial search space. We start by addressing isotonicity shape constraint using a dynamic programming algorithm and demonstrate how the problem can be mapped to the graph combinatorics domain. Next we show how a number of other important shape constraints including unimodality, convexity, limited level set, and limited slope can be addressed using the same framework. The flexibility of proposed framework enables solving the shape constrained regression problem with an arbitrary user-defined error metric. This flexibility is exploited to add robustness against outliers to the model. The algorithms are described in detail and their computational complexity is established. The performance and effectiveness of the shape constrained regression is evaluated on traces of temperature and humidity measurements from a deployed sensor network where a high degree of accuracy and robustness is demonstrated.","","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2028937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208301","Convex;isotonic;nonparametric;robust regression;shaped constrained regression;unimodal","Robustness;Temperature sensors;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Combinatorial mathematics;Level set;Computational complexity;Shape measurement;Temperature measurement;Humidity measurement","dynamic programming;parameter estimation;regression analysis;wireless sensor networks","nonparametric combinatorial regression;shape constrained modeling;isotonicity shape constraint;dynamic programming algorithm;graph combinatorics domain;temperature measurement;humidity measurement;sensor network","","1","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such an optimization problem has both a discrete feasible region, due to the combinatoric nature of channel pairing, and a discrete objective, due to the bit loading requirement. For this type of mixed-integer programming problems, the Lagrange dual method generally is inapplicable, due to the non-zero duality gap. However, by exploring the structure of our problem, we are able to bound the gap to within one bit, allowing the extraction of an exact optimal integer solution. We further present complexity reduction techniques, and demonstrate that the proposed solution only requires a computational complexity that is polynomial in the number of channels, realizing efficient implementation in practical systems. Through numerical experiments, we show that the jointly optimal solution can significantly outperform common sub-optimal alternatives.","","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195810","","Resource management;Loading;Relays;Optimization;Bit rate;Modulation;OFDM","channel allocation;duality (mathematics);integer programming;wireless channels","optimal bit loading;channel pairing;power allocation;multichannel relaying;end-to-end rate;dual-hop relay network;multiple channels format;finite modulation format;integer bit loading;discrete feasible region;discrete objective;mixed-integer programming problem;Lagrange dual method;nonzero duality gap;optimal integer solution;complexity reduction technique","","5","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VRP aims to produce a set of shortest routes from several of the same capacity vehicles to visit several customers at a certain time limit. Depot is the starting and ending point of the route. Due to the complexity of industry needs, the VRP problem needs to be improved into a multi-objective. Most of VRP prior researches only minimize total distance as a single objective. Therefore, in this study added an objective related to the balance of distances between routes. In prior researches, multi-objective VRP was solved using metaheuristic. It requires the determination of parameters and specific algorithm design to solve each problem domain. To overcome these shortcomings, this study uses a hyper-heuristic method to complete multi-objective VRP. Given that the use of hyper-heuristics in previous studies is for single objective VRP, so this study also proposes hyper-heuristic for multi-objective VRP. Gehring and Homberger dataset is used for the experiment.

Its attention can be partially attributed to its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches.","","","10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2424894","NSF; NIH; DoD; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091002","Graph matching;convex optimization;Frank-Wolfe;assignment problem;random graphs","Random variables;Bismuth;Manganese;Stochastic processes;Pattern matching;Communities;Transmission line matrix methods","graph theory;pattern matching","convex optimum;indefinite relaxation;gradient-descent-type algorithms;continuous problem;discrete problem;graph matching","Algorithms;Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Binomial Distribution;Brain Mapping;Caenorhabditis elegans;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;Humans;Mathematical Concepts;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","24","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Combinatorics shows that even a moderately sized search requires problem-specific information to be successful. Computers, despite their speed in performing queries, are completely inadequate for resolving even moderately sized search problems without accurate information to guide them. We propose three measures to characterize the information required for successful search: 1) endogenous information, which measures the difficulty of finding a target using random search; 2) exogenous information, which measures the difficulty that remains in finding a target once a search takes advantage of problem-specific information; and 3) active information, which, as the difference between endogenous and exogenous information, measures the contribution of problem-specific information for successfully finding a target. This paper develops a methodology based on these information measures to gauge the effectiveness with which problem-specific information facilitates successful search. It then applies this methodology to various search tools widely used in evolutionary search.","","","10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2025027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204206","Active information;asymptotic equipartition property;Brillouin active information;conservation of information (COI);endogenous information;evolutionary search;genetic algorithms;Kullback–Leibler distance;no free lunch theorem (NFLT);partitioned search","Costs;Genetic algorithms;Design optimization;Performance evaluation;Combinatorial mathematics;Search problems;Partitioning algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Humans","information theory;search problems","information theorems;search algorithm;random search;problem-specific information;search-space structure;endogenous information;evolutionary search","","23","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different conditional statements on moving averages are represented as strings, encodable as chromosomes in an approach based on genetic algorithm. The data mining of good investment strategies corresponds to the extraction of rules that are fit in the sense of evolutionary computation. Three different kinds of moving averages (simple moving average, exponential moving average and adaptive moving average) of various durations have been used in the conditional statement involving the closing price of a given stock. The performance of a given investment strategy is evaluated using the rate of overall return in both the training set and the test set, thereby converting the problem of discovering good investment strategies to an optimization problem in combinatorics, which is solved with a genetic algorithm approach. Stock data from NASDAQ, including Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and Dell are tested and comparisons of genetic algorithms with benchmark methods such as random walk, buy and hold, and exhaustive search are performed. Results show evidence of superior performance in genetic algorithm in term of the rate of overall return for the test set.

The practical applications of FHE have performance bottleneck due to the complexity of operations involved. FHE usually supports addition and multiplication as the two primitive operations, which further enable arbitrary computations on encrypted data. Of these, multiplication is computationally expensive operation in homomorphic domain when compared to addition. Hence, computations involving high number of multiplications have performance issues. In this paper, we improve the performance of a narrow class of multiplication intensive computational problems in encrypted domain that have finite result space. We solve such problems using search on publicly known unencrypted database of result space instead of computing the problem using traditional methods over encrypted data. This class of multiplication-intensive computations can be solved efficiently by searching due to fewer number of multiplications involved when compared to traditional computation, providing high performance improvement. Furthermore, we improve the performance of search algorithm by exploiting boolean arithmetic when search is performed over a public dataset. We illustrate this two-level optimization using factorial computation on encrypted data and demonstrate that a simple optimization of solving factorial as a search problem shows enormous performance improvement when compared to direct computation in encrypted domain. Factorial is an important primitive in several disciplines such as combinatorics, probability theory etc. which are building blocks of cloud analytics. We demonstrate through experiments that computation of factorial efficiently in turn improves the performance of such applications considerably. This optimization can be used to improve performance of other multiplication-intensive computational problems like exponentiation, binomial computations, and other domain specific computations.","","","10.1109/SmartCloud.2018.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8513713","Searching, Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Computational Problem, Comparison, Cloud Computing","Encryption;Cloud computing;Search problems;Indexes;Sorting;Data privacy","Boolean algebra;computational complexity;cryptography;data privacy;search problems","multiplication-intensive computational problems;FHE data;encrypted data;multiplication intensive computational problems;multiplication-intensive computations;factorial computation;search problem;Fully Homomorphic Encryption;crypto-system;search algorithm;boolean arithmetic;cryptography","","","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work is motivated by the current overloaded airspace near large airports and the need of more efficient methods to help controllers. Some attempts to alleviate airspace congestion such as the minimum spacing requirements, negotiation of voluntary reductions in scheduled service, and the construction of additional runways at major airports have been done. Even though, more fundamental changes are needed to improve the use of available air capacity. Present research consists of a new approach to optimize a set of aircraft planned to land at a given airport; it is proposed to merge the incoming flows from different routes by mean of speed and path changes. Due to the high combinatoric induced by such a problem, a stochastic optimization algorithm has been developed in order to propose to each aircraft a new route and speed profile. Those changes aim to remove conflicts at merging points and to maintain separation of aircraft following the same route link according to their wake turbulence constraint. The optimization criteria is based on the minimum deviation from the initial path planning. This algorithm has been successfully applied to Gran Canaria airport in Spain with real traffic demand samples for which conflict free flow merging is produced smoothly with optimal runway feeding.","","","10.1109/DASC.2011.6095980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095980","","","","","","2","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We mathematically formulate the mutually beneficial relationship between mobile hotspots and clients into an optimization problem, with the objective of conducting the cooperative wireless data and energy transmission to maximize the system utility. Resorting to methods from combinatorics and matching theory, we develop a near optimal solution for many-to-one matching when there is a single mobile hotspot and a distributed matching strategy for the general case by considering the nature of data communication and the characteristic of wireless power transfer.
